## Day 1: Introduction to Cultural Conversations

### Warm-up (10 minutes)

1. Discuss the importance of cultural context in language learning:
   - How language reflects cultural values and perspectives
   - The role of cultural understanding in effective communication
   - Why cultural authenticity matters in language practice

2. Introduce how AI tools can help practice conversations in culturally authentic contexts:
   - Simulating conversations with speakers from target cultures
   - Providing cultural background information
   - Offering language support and feedback

### Exploring Cultural Scenarios (20 minutes)

1. Present several cultural scenarios relevant to the target language:
   - Ordering in a local restaurant
   - Navigating public transportation
   - Participating in a cultural celebration
   - Shopping in a local market
   - Visiting a historic site

2. For each scenario, discuss:
   - Key vocabulary and phrases
   - Cultural norms and expectations
   - Non-verbal communication aspects
   - Potential cultural misunderstandings

### AI Conversation Demonstration (15 minutes)

1. Demonstrate how to use AI tools for conversational practice:
   - Setting up a culturally appropriate scenario
   - Using the CRAFT framework to create effective prompts
   - Engaging in a sample conversation
   - Analyzing the cultural authenticity of the responses

2. Show students how to:
   - Request cultural explanations
   - Ask for alternative phrasing
   - Verify cultural information
   - Switch between formal/informal registers

### Preparation (5 minutes)

1. Assign each student or pair a cultural scenario to explore
2. Provide guidelines for creating effective conversation prompts
3. Preview homework: researching cultural context for their scenario

## Day 2: Practice and Development

### Cultural Research Review (10 minutes)

1. Students share key cultural insights from their research
2. Address common misconceptions or questions about cultural contexts
3. Provide additional cultural background as needed

### Guided Conversation Practice (25 minutes)

1. Students work individually or in pairs to:
   - Set up their cultural scenario with an AI tool
   - Practice conversational exchanges
   - Document interesting cultural elements
   - Note new vocabulary or expressions

2. Teacher circulates to:
   - Provide guidance on prompt formulation
   - Help evaluate cultural authenticity
   - Suggest follow-up questions
   - Address language questions

### Critical Analysis (15 minutes)

1. Class discussion about the AI conversation experience:
   - What cultural elements seemed authentic?
   - What aspects seemed inaccurate or stereotypical?
   - How did the AI handle cultural nuances?
   - What new cultural insights did students gain?

2. Compare AI conversations with authentic materials:
   - Video clips of similar real-world interactions
   - Cultural perspectives from native speakers
   - Differences in phrasing or cultural approaches

## Day 3: Extension and Assessment

### Conversation Refinement (20 minutes)

1. Students revise their conversation scenarios based on:
   - Cultural feedback from day 2
   - More specific cultural contexts
   - More complex language structures
   - More authentic cultural references

2. Students practice refined conversations with:
   - More detailed cultural elements
   - More nuanced language use
   - More authentic conversational flow

### Peer Exchange (15 minutes)

1. Students exchange scenarios with partners and:
   - Try each other's cultural scenarios
   - Provide feedback on cultural authenticity
   - Suggest improvements or extensions
   - Share interesting cultural discoveries

### Final Reflection and Assessment (15 minutes)

1. Students complete a reflection addressing:
