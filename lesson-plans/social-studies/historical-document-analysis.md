## Introduction to Historical Document Analysis (15 minutes)

### Traditional Document Analysis

1. Review the key elements of historical document analysis:
   - Author and audience
   - Context and purpose
   - Main arguments or themes
   - Evidence and reasoning
   - Historical significance

2. Discuss how historians approach primary source documents:
   - Corroborating with other sources
   - Considering multiple perspectives
   - Placing documents in historical context
   - Identifying bias and point of view

### Introducing AI-Assisted Analysis

1. Explain how AI tools can assist with historical document analysis:
   - Identifying key themes and concepts
   - Providing historical context
   - Suggesting related primary sources
   - Highlighting potential biases or perspectives

2. Discuss limitations of AI in historical analysis:
   - Potential for anachronistic interpretations
   - Limited understanding of historical nuance
   - Possible reinforcement of dominant historical narratives
   - Need for human oversight and critical thinking

## Guided Practice: Comparative Analysis (20 minutes)

1. Distribute copies of a historical document (e.g., Declaration of Independence, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, letter from a historical figure)

2. First, guide students through traditional document analysis:
   - Who created this document and when?
   - What was happening at the time (historical context)?
   - Who was the intended audience?
   - What are the key arguments or claims?
   - What evidence does the author provide?

3. Then, demonstrate AI-assisted analysis of the same document:
   - Show effective prompting using the CRAFT framework
   - Model how to ask AI to identify themes, context, and perspectives
   - Demonstrate critical evaluation of AI responses
   - Compare and contrast with traditional analysis

## Independent Practice (30-45 minutes)

1. Assign students a new historical document or set of documents

2. Have students complete:
   - Traditional document analysis worksheet
   - AI-assisted analysis using provided prompting guidelines
   - Comparative reflection on both approaches

3. Guiding questions for their analysis:
   - What new insights did the AI tool provide?
   - What aspects did the AI tool miss or misinterpret?
   - How did the AI's historical context compare to your textbook or prior knowledge?
   - In what ways was the traditional analysis more effective?
   - How might historians use AI tools while maintaining scholarly standards?

## Group Discussion and Reflection (15 minutes)

1. Small group sharing:
   - What were the most significant differences between traditional and AI-assisted analysis?
   - What surprised you about the AI's interpretation of the document?
   - How might AI tools change how we study history?

2. Whole class discussion:
   - Benefits and limitations of AI in historical research
   - The continued importance of historical thinking skills
   - Ethical considerations in AI-assisted historical interpretation

## Assessment: Comparative Analysis Project

Students will complete a comparative analysis project that includes:

1. Analysis of 2-3 historical documents related to a specific event or period
2. Documentation of both traditional and AI-assisted analysis methods
3. A reflective essay comparing the effectiveness of both approaches
4. Recommendations for how historians might effectively use AI tools

## Extension Activities

- Research how professional historians are beginning to use AI tools
- Create an instructional guide for other students on effective AI prompting for historical documents
- Analyze how different AI tools interpret the same historical document differently
- Investigate how AI might reinforce or challenge dominant historical narratives
