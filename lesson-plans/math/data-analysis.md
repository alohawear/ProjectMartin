## Day 1: Introduction to AI-Assisted Data Analysis

### Opening (15 minutes)

1. Begin with a discussion about how data is used in various fields and the role AI plays in modern data analysis.
2. Show examples of AI-generated data visualizations and discuss their strengths and limitations.
3. Introduce the project and datasets students will be working with.

### AI Tool Introduction (25 minutes)

1. Demonstrate how to use AI tools to assist with data analysis tasks:
   - Cleaning and formatting data
   - Generating initial visualizations
   - Identifying patterns and trends

2. Share the CRAFT framework for interacting with AI tools responsibly, highlighting the importance of:
   - Providing clear context about the data
   - Specifying the type of analysis needed
   - Being specific about visualization requirements

### Hands-on Exploration (40 minutes)

1. Divide students into pairs and distribute the sample datasets.
2. Guide students through initial data exploration using both traditional methods and AI assistance.
3. Have students document differences in their approach and findings.

### Closing (10 minutes)

1. Discuss initial observations about using AI for data analysis.
2. Preview Day 2 activities and assign any preparation work.

## Day 2: Advanced Analysis and Presentation

### Opening (10 minutes)

1. Review key concepts from Day 1
2. Address common challenges students encountered
3. Explain the final project requirements

### Guided Practice (30 minutes)

1. Demonstrate advanced AI prompting techniques for:
   - Creating specific types of visualizations
   - Identifying correlations and patterns
   - Generating hypotheses based on data

2. Show how to critically evaluate AI-generated analysis:
   - Checking for statistical validity
   - Identifying potential biases
   - Verifying conclusions with multiple approaches

### Independent Work (40 minutes)

1. Students work on their final analysis projects:
   - Selecting appropriate visualizations
   - Developing insights from the data
   - Preparing presentation materials

2. As students work, circulate to provide guidance and feedback.

### Presentations and Discussion (10 minutes)

1. Selected students share their findings and visualizations.
2. Class discusses different approaches and insights.

## Follow-up Activities

- Reflective writing on how AI tools enhanced or changed the data analysis process
- Extension activity applying these techniques to data from another subject area
- Discussion about ethical considerations in AI-assisted data analysis
