## Introduction (10 minutes)

1. Begin with a discussion about AI writing tools:
   - What are they?
   - How are they currently being used?
   - What are potential benefits and concerns?

2. Share examples of AI-generated writing alongside human writing, and discuss differences and similarities.

## Exploration (15 minutes)

1. Demonstrate an AI writing assistant, showing:
   - How to write effective prompts
   - How to generate ideas
   - How to request revisions or improvements
   - How to fact-check AI-generated content

2. Discuss the concept of "AI as a writing partner" rather than a replacement for human creativity.

## Practice Activity (30 minutes)

1. Provide students with a writing prompt and ask them to:
   - First, brainstorm ideas independently (5 minutes)
   - Then, use an AI tool to generate additional ideas (5 minutes)
   - Compare their ideas with AI-generated suggestions
   - Begin drafting their response, using AI as needed for:
     - Overcoming writer's block
     - Suggesting alternative wording
     - Checking grammar and structure

2. As students work, circulate to provide guidance on effective AI prompting and maintaining authorship.

## Reflection and Discussion (15 minutes)

1. Have students share their experiences:
   - How did the AI tool help their writing process?
   - What challenges did they encounter?
   - How did they ensure their voice remained in the writing?

2. Discuss ethical considerations:
   - When is AI assistance appropriate vs. inappropriate?
   - How should AI-assisted work be cited or acknowledged?
   - How might AI tools impact the development of writing skills?

## Extension Activity (10 minutes)

1. Have students write a brief reflection on how they might use AI writing tools in future assignments, setting personal guidelines for their use.

## Adaptations

- For younger students: Simplify the writing prompt and focus more on using AI for brainstorming rather than drafting.
- For advanced students: Explore more complex prompting techniques and have students experiment with using AI for different genres of writing.
