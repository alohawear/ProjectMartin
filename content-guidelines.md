# Project Martin: AI in Education

## Overview
Project Martin aims to integrate AI technologies responsibly into K-12 education, providing educators with frameworks, resources, and lesson plans aligned with district policies. Our approach is built on established AI integration frameworks while ensuring compliance with MNPS AI Policy and NCDPI Generative Implementation Recommendations.

## Core Frameworks

### CRAFT Prompting Framework
The CRAFT framework guides educators and students in creating effective prompts for AI tools:

- **C**ontext: Providing clear background information
- **R**ole: Specifying the expertise needed
- **A**udience: Identifying who the output is for 
- **F**ormat: Detailing the desired output format
- **T**one: Setting the appropriate style and approach

### EVERY Framework for Responsible AI Use
The EVERY framework ensures ethical and responsible use of AI-generated content:

- **E**valuate the results to determine if they meet needs
- **V**erify facts, figures, quotes, and data
- **E**ngage in every conversation with critical feedback
- **R**evise AI output to reflect unique needs and style
- **Y**ou are responsible for everything created with AI

### OFFLINE for Privacy and Safety
The OFFLINE framework provides guidance for secure AI data management:

- **O**wn It: Use your own computing infrastructure
- **F**ortify It: Implement robust security on your AI systems
- **F**ine-tune It: Customize the model for your application
- **L**ocalize It: Keep the data as close to the student as possible
- **I**solate It: Keep your AI system separate from other network resources
- **N**urture It: Iterate on your models with new data and methods
- **E**ncrypt It: Encrypt data stored on AI systems

### 0 to Infinity: Student AI Integration Continuum
Our approach to student use of AI follows this continuum:

- **AI-Free/AI-Resistant**: Problems designed to be completed without AI
- **AI-Assisted**: AI used for specific tasks (brainstorming, planning, etc.)
- **AI-Enhanced**: AI integrated throughout with human oversight
- **AI-Empowered**: Using AI to create innovative solutions
