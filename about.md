# About Bridge to AI

Bridge to AI is an educational initiative designed to help teachers and educators effectively integrate AI tools into their teaching practices. Our mission is to empower educators with the knowledge, resources, and frameworks they need to harness the potential of AI in education.

## Our Mission

We believe that AI has the potential to transform education by:

- Personalizing learning experiences for students
- Reducing administrative burden on teachers
- Enhancing creativity and critical thinking
- Providing new opportunities for student engagement

However, we recognize that many educators face challenges in adopting these new technologies. Bridge to AI aims to bridge this gap by providing accessible resources, lesson plans, and frameworks that make AI integration straightforward and beneficial.

## What We Offer

- **Lesson Plans**: Ready-to-use AI-enhanced lesson plans across various subjects
- **Frameworks**: Structured approaches to integrating AI tools in teaching
- **Resources**: Guides, articles, and tutorials on effective AI use in education
- **Community**: A place for educators to share experiences and best practices

## Our Values

- **Equity**: Ensuring AI tools benefit all students regardless of background
- **Ethics**: Promoting responsible and ethical use of AI in education
- **Empowerment**: Giving teachers the confidence to leverage AI effectively
- **Excellence**: Maintaining high standards in all our educational resources

## Our Foundations

The Bridge to AI project draws inspiration from the [North Carolina Department of Public Instruction Generative AI Implementation Guidelines](https://go.ncdpi.gov/AI_Guidelines), adapting their framework to meet the specific needs of Nashville Public Schools teachers and students. These guidelines provide a robust foundation for responsible and effective AI integration in educational settings.
