# About Bridge to AI

Bridge to AI is an educational initiative designed born out of the Nashville Public Education Foundation's Teacherpreneur program in 2005. Our goal is to help Nashville's educators effectively integrate AI tools into their teaching practices. Our mission is to empower educators with the knowledge and resources to give their students equitable access to important new skills.

## Our Mission

We believe that AI has the potential to transform education by:

- Personalizing learning experiences for students
- Enhancing creativity and critical thinking
