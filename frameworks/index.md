# AI Teaching Frameworks

Effective integration of AI in the classroom requires a structured approach. Our frameworks provide teachers with practical models for using AI tools to enhance teaching and learning while addressing important considerations like ethics, privacy, and effective implementation.

Inspired by the [North Carolina DPI Generative AI Implementation Guidelines](https://go.ncdpi.gov/AI_Guidelines), our frameworks have been customized for Nashville Public Schools to support teachers in leveraging AI effectively and responsibly in their classrooms.

## Available Frameworks

### CRAFT Prompting Framework

The [CRAFT Framework](./craft/) guides educators and students in creating effective prompts for AI tools by focusing on **C**ontext, **R**ole, **A**udience, **F**ormat, and **T**one. This framework helps teachers and students craft prompts that generate more useful and appropriate AI responses.

### EVERY Framework for Responsible AI Use

The [EVERY Framework](./every/) ensures ethical and responsible use of AI-generated content. It reminds users to **E**valuate results, **V**erify facts, **E**ngage critically, **R**evise outputs, and take responsibility ("**Y**ou") for all AI-created content, promoting a thoughtful approach to AI implementation.

### OFFLINE Framework for Privacy and Safety

The [OFFLINE Framework](./offline/) provides guidance for secure AI data management with principles to **O**wn infrastructure, **F**ortify security, **F**ine-tune models, **L**ocalize data, **I**solate systems, **N**urture improvements, and **E**ncrypt information, keeping student data safe and private.

### 0 to Infinity: Student AI Integration Continuum

The [0 to Infinity Continuum](./zero-infinity/) offers a spectrum of approaches to student use of AI, from AI-Free/AI-Resistant tasks designed to be completed without AI, through AI-Assisted and AI-Enhanced activities, to AI-Empowered projects that use AI for innovative solutions.

## How to Use These Frameworks

Each framework includes:

- A clear conceptual model
- Implementation guidelines
- Example activities and lessons
- Assessment strategies
- Ethical considerations

Teachers are encouraged to adapt these frameworks to suit their specific contexts, subject areas, and student needs.
