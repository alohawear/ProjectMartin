# The OFFLINE Framework for Privacy and Safety

The OFFLINE framework provides guidance for secure AI data management when using AI in educational settings. This framework helps protect student privacy while enabling effective use of AI tools for teaching and learning.

## The OFFLINE Principles

### **O**wn It: Use your own computing infrastructure

- Deploy AI tools on school-controlled servers when possible
- Understand the ownership of data processed through AI systems
- Take responsibility for AI systems used in your educational setting
- Maintain control over how AI systems are configured and used

### **F**ortify It: Implement robust security on your AI systems

- Apply security best practices to all AI deployments
- Use strong authentication for access to AI systems
- Regularly update and patch AI infrastructure 
- Conduct security assessments of AI tools
- Train staff on security protocols for AI use

### **F**ine-tune It: Customize the model for your application

- Adapt AI models to meet specific educational needs
- Consider fine-tuning models with curriculum-aligned content
- Customize AI responses to align with educational objectives
- Adjust AI systems for age-appropriate interactions
- Tailor AI tools to support specific learning outcomes

### **L**ocalize It: Keep the data as close to the student as possible

- Minimize data transmission to external servers
- Store student data on local or district-controlled infrastructure
- Understand data flow in AI systems used in classrooms
- Process student information locally when possible

### **I**solate It: Keep your AI system separate from other network resources

- Implement network segmentation for AI systems
- Use dedicated environments for AI applications
- Separate AI systems from core administrative systems
- Establish clear data boundaries for AI applications

### **N**urture It: Iterate on your models with new data and methods

- Continuously improve AI implementations
- Update AI systems with relevant educational content
- Refine AI tools based on teacher and student feedback
- Evolve security practices as technology changes
- Maintain and improve AI models over time

### **E**ncrypt It: Encrypt data stored on AI systems

- Use encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Implement strong encryption standards for all student data
- Ensure secure transmission of information to and from AI systems
- Protect sensitive information with appropriate encryption
- Use encrypted channels for all AI interactions

## Implementation Strategies

### For School Leaders

1. Develop an OFFLINE-aligned AI policy for your school or district
2. Provide professional development on data privacy and AI ethics
3. Create approved lists of AI tools that meet privacy and security standards
4. Establish clear protocols for responding to data concerns
5. Regularly update policies as AI technologies evolve

### For Teachers

1. Understand your school's data policies before implementing AI tools
2. Create classroom-specific guidelines based on the OFFLINE principles
3. Communicate expectations clearly to students and parents
4. Model responsible data practices in your own use of AI
5. Include lessons on digital citizenship and AI ethics

### For Students

1. Learn about personal data protection and online privacy
2. Understand when and how to safely use AI tools for learning
3. Practice critical evaluation of AI-generated content
4. Recognize the importance of developing independent skills
5. Report concerns about AI tools or outputs to teachers

The OFFLINE framework was developed by Bridge to AI to help address some of the legal and policy requirements of AI use in an educational setting. It helps create educational environments where AI tools enhance learning while maintaining appropriate safeguards for student data and privacy. By implementing these principles, schools can navigate the benefits and challenges of AI integration responsibly.
