# The CRAFT Prompting Framework

The CRAFT framework guides educators and students in creating effective prompts for AI tools:

- **C**ontext: Providing clear background information
- **R**ole: Specifying the expertise needed
- **A**udience: Identifying who the output is for 
- **F**ormat: Detailing the desired output format
- **T**one: Setting the appropriate style and approach

## Examples in Education

### Example 1: Math Word Problem Generator

```
Context: I'm teaching a 7th-grade math class on proportional relationships.
Role: You are an experienced middle school math teacher who specializes in creating engaging word problems.
Audience: The problems will be for 7th-grade students with varied math abilities.
Format: Create 5 word problems that involve proportional relationships in real-world contexts. Each problem should include the solution steps.
Tone: Make the problems relatable and interesting for 13-year-old students. Use scenarios they would find relevant.
```

### Example 2: Historical Document Analysis

```
Context: My 10th-grade history class is studying the Civil Rights Movement.
Role: You are a historian specializing in 20th century American civil rights history.
Audience: The analysis is for high school sophomores who have basic knowledge of the civil rights era.
Format: Analyze the attached speech excerpt, highlighting 3 key rhetorical devices and explaining their historical significance. Include 2-3 discussion questions.
Tone: Academic but accessible, avoiding overly complex terminology.
```

## Implementation Guide

1. **Identify Your Need**: Determine exactly what you want the AI to produce
2. **Complete Each Element**:
   - Context: What background information does the AI need?
   - Role: What expertise should the AI emulate?
   - Audience: Who will use the output?
   - Format: What structure should the output follow?
   - Tone: What style or voice is appropriate?
3. **Review and Refine**: Check your prompt for clarity and specificity
4. **Test and Iterate**: Try your prompt and refine based on results
